## Build dependencies and binary releases

PyInstaller is used only to produce optional standalone executables and is not
vendored into this repository; it is a build-only dependency licensed under
GPL-2.0-or-later with its special exception. A bundled executable contains
runtime dependencies (including NVIDIA user-space libraries collected from the
Torch wheels at build time) and may create license, notice, source-offer,
codec, or platform obligations beyond source distribution. Review the complete
bundled artifact and all dependency licenses before publishing a binary
release.
